# Original description:
Since the beginnings of GMod people have had to deal with constantly having to use-shift, right click, right click, use-shift to place things. No more! Physgun Build Mode adds a whole host of settings to your physgun, and it'll change the way you build. New settings include auto-freeze/sleep, auto-nocollide, GMod 9 style rotation, snap to grid, and snap to angles. If you're a person who uses the physgun but also demands precision, you'll want this tool. In fact, you'll find it useful even if you're like me and barely use the physgun for building.

Fed up with constantly having to right click to freeze things? Keep needing to bring out the nocollide tool just to place props? Always having to use servers with smaller angle snap settings? With this everything's automatic, and each player can set their own settings individually so everyone's happy.

To access Physgun Build Mode, just look in your Q menu Options tab. You can toggle it on/off there, or alternatively you can use the concommand "phys_buildmode" to toggle it on and off. I usually recommend binding it to a key for super quick access.
